              Skin Booster Prophilo is a type of injectable treatment that combines
                hyaluronic acid and a high concentration of bio-remodeling agents. Not
                only design to improve skin firmness, hydration and elasticity, but it
                remodels ageing and sagging skin by stimulating the production of 4
                different types of collagen and elastin. Prophilo can help with skin
                laxity, fine lines, and loss of volume in areas such as the face,
                neck, and hands.
