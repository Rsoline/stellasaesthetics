              (Renata after AI) In order to effectively and sustainably loose weight, it is important to focus on well balance diet that includes a variety of food groups and paying attention to portion sizes.
              Incorporating regular exercise is also crucial for weight loss, as it aids in burning calories and increasing metabolism.
              Alongside these dietary changes, body treatments also can complement the weight loss journey.
